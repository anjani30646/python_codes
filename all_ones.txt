You are given a string of 1s and 0s only and a number K.
Your task is to write a program that convert the given string to a string that consists of
all 1s.
But there's a catch. You are only allowed to use one kind of operation :
Take exactly k consecutive elements of the string and apply the flip operation on every 
element, ie. change 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.
Each operation takes 1 second so you have to print the minimum time required to make the 
string of 1's only. If not possible print -1.

    c1=0
    for i in range(len(s)-k+1):
        if s[i]=='0':
            c=c+1
            for j in range(i,i+k):
                if s[j]=='0':
                    s[j]='1'
                else:
                    s[j]='0'
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i]=='0':
            c1=c1+1
    #print(s)
    if(c1>0):
        print('-1')
    else:
